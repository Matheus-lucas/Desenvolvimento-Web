                <p><strong> Lorem Ipsum </strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
                    Ipsum has been the industry's
                    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                    scrambled it to make
                    a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                    typesetting,
                    remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                    containing
                    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
                    including versions
                    of Lorem Ipsum.
